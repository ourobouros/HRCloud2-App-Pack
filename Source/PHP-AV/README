It is currently March of 2017 and PHP-AV has changed 
considerably since the mid 2000's when it was written 
by Fujitsuboy and uploaded to SourceForge. The 
following readme file was written for the original 
release of PHP-AV, and is preserved for historical value.

Please see the official HRCloud2 wiki for App specific
specifications and details.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION
------------------

	Welcome to PHP Anti-Virus. I wrote this script because of server
	vulnerabilities that allowed spammers to deface web sites and append spyware
	to any public web site they pleased. Although preventable, it is yet
	undetectable (until a visitor complains, or you next test every page on the
	site).

	This script scans the base web files folder recursively for malicious code
	that may have snuck into publically accessable web files.

	Version 1.0.1 brings a few enhancements over the original release, but
	please be patient as it is still early days yet.


 2.0 INSTALLATION
------------------

	Please see INSTALL for installation instructions.


 3.0 WANTED LIST
-----------------

	* Complete virus definition list, constantly updated (massive problem!)
	* Better documentation for "non techies"
	* Nicer interface for configuration and scanning
	* Centralised administration for multiple webspaces - script to include an
	  XML connector for local Java(?) client to retrieve and report. Possibly
	  found a Java programmer :)

	If you have any feature requests, please log them on our SourceForge
	project page for easy maintenance and tracking.


 4.0 AUTHORS
-------------

	At the moment it's just myself, FujitsuBoy (aka Keyboard Artist). I hope
	I've found a Java programmer for the centralisable end-client, but new
	members would be very useful. I'm currently looking for:

	* Someone experienced enough to help write virus definition updates
	* Web hosting companies who have seen more exploits than hot dinners
	* PHP "gurus" i.e. if you can't write it blindfold STFU

	Please e-mail me if you have enough time on your hands and you're king of
	your art. I can see a lot of potential in this script - as I say, early
	days!
